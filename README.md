Notes on unit tests in general.  Most langauges have a way of calling and running code you have written to see if the behaviur is as expected.
Examples include:
	- Java - JUnit
	- JavaScript - Jest
	- C# - MSTest
	- etc

Setting up GUT:
	- create a folder called "test"  (need to investigate this, not sure why we need this yet)
	- AssetLib, search for and install GUT
	- Project Settings - Plugins - Enable 
	- Restart
